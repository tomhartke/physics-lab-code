 ## Paper analysis code 
 
These python notebooks are used to process large datasets of images to probe various physical phenomena (each is from a different published paper or report). 

They usually reside in a folder with the experimental data.

The usual setup is simple: read in the data, perform some analysis, and plot the results. 

## Physics simulations in Mathematica

These are files to be opened in the program "Mathematica". 

They simulate various physical phenomena of interest, such as the time dynamics of a quantum system, or energy spectra.
