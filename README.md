# physics-lab-code

## Summary

These are examples of python and Mathematica code written during the course of my atomic physics PhD to solve specific problems in data analysis, running the experiment, or simulating physics.

They are not high quality code (in general, there aren't clean explanations, hierarchical function definitions, or offloading of repeated tasks into imported packages, etc). They were generally meant to be used for a limited purpose and amount of time on a specific task. 


## Specific code 
 
### Analysis-for-papers
 
These python notebooks are used to process large datasets of images to probe various physical phenomena (each is from a different published paper or report). They usually reside in a folder with the experimental data (experimental data has not been copied here).

The usual structure of each file is simple: 
1. Read in the data
2. Perform some analysis
3. Plot the results for use in talks, papers, etc.

### Physics-simulations-mathematica

These are files to be opened in the program "Mathematica". 

They simulate various physical phenomena of interest, such as the time dynamics of a quantum system, or energy spectra.
